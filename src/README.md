# src

`vexml` is composed of three libraries:

- [musicxml](./musicxml/README.md): Organize data from a MusicXML document so that it can be read easily in TypeScript.
- [rendering](./rendering/README.md): Take MusicXML data and transform it into `vexflow` objects.
- `util`: Miscellaneous functionality that doesn't neatly fit into either library or needs to be shared.

[src/vexml.ts](./vexml.ts) is the entrypoint for MusicXML rendering.
